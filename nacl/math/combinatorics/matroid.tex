This template assumes 2 weighted matroids of the same type, and that removing
an element is much more expensive than checking if one can be added.
\textbf{Remember to change the implementation details.}

The ground set is $0, 1, \dots, n - 1$, where element $i$ has weight $w[i]$.
For the unweighted version, remove weights and change BF/SPFA to BFS.
